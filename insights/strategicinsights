Strategic Insights & Business Implications (Recruiter-Facing)
These insights reflect a deep understanding of operational KPIs, user behavior, and platform efficiency — all of which are critical to data-driven decision-making in a ride-hailing business.

1. High Ride Cancellation Rate (10.9%)
Business Impact: Lost revenue, poor rider experience, reduced driver motivation.
Analyst Insight: Cancellation rates are significantly above typical industry benchmarks (usually 3–7%). This suggests systemic friction, possibly due to:

Driver supply gaps or long wait times

Poor ETAs or app matching delays

Weak feedback loops after cancellations

Recommendations:

Segment cancellations by city, hour, and user cohort to pinpoint root causes

Introduce real-time driver load balancing logic for high-cancellation zones

Build a cancellation prediction model (logistic regression or tree-based) to preempt risk triggers

A/B test new app UI flows or cancellation penalties/incentives

Value Add: This approach reduces loss per cancelled ride and improves NPS scores, helping the business retain riders and drivers.

2. Underutilized Driver Supply in Key Cities
Business Impact: Reduced revenue per driver, uneven user experience (delays in high-demand areas)
Analyst Insight: A subset of drivers complete <5 rides/week while others are highly active, suggesting supply-demand mismatch. Without intervention, this could:

Increase churn among idle drivers

Lead to longer ETAs for users

Increase operational cost per ride

Recommendations:

Create a “Driver Utilization Index”: Rides per active hour, revenue per km, idle-to-active time ratio

Visualize supply-demand heatmaps by hour and geography

Optimize incentive payouts based on smart utilization clusters

Pilot dynamic shift assignments to guide idle drivers to demand zones

Value Add: This ensures a more evenly distributed fleet, lowers cost per completed ride, and enhances rider wait times — a direct lever for retention.

3. Stable Revenue per Ride but Untapped Dynamic Pricing
Business Impact: Predictable income but missed opportunities to maximize margin
Analyst Insight: The average fare ($9.33) and payment ($9.32) are almost identical. This flat pricing structure suggests:

No discounting or surge logic implemented

No usage of ride-time forecasting models

Limited monetization during high-demand hours

Recommendations:

Simulate surge pricing multipliers by time and location using historical demand

Segment rider personas (e.g., commuters, casual, weekend users) and apply tailored promos

Introduce LTV-based pricing logic — offer incentives to high-LTV users and upsell ride classes

Value Add: Improves contribution margin per ride and builds habit loops with dynamic pricing psychology.

4. Lack of Retention Measurement is a Blind Spot
Business Impact: No clear understanding of user stickiness, campaign ROI, or lifecycle behavior
Analyst Insight: While the data supports strong transactional analytics, it lacks user retention logic. For growth-focused analytics, retention is a foundational KPI.

Recommendations:

Simulate a users table with registration dates and ride logs

Calculate 7-day and 30-day retention curves (Cohort analysis)

Use funnel analytics (First ride → 2nd ride → Week 1 → Week 4)

Model churn likelihood using ride gaps or app inactivity

Value Add: Informs lifecycle campaigns, boosts ROI on acquisition, and reduces churn-related CAC loss.

5. Reporting is Functional but Can Be Strategic
Business Impact: Decision-makers need trends, not just snapshots
Analyst Insight: Weekly automation scripts provide good snapshots, but don't yet show growth patterns or forecast key metrics.

Recommendations:

Add MoM / WoW growth indicators into weekly reporting scripts

Introduce anomaly detection logic (e.g., spikes in cancellations or inactive drivers)

Forecast key metrics like revenue and supply using time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet)

Value Add: Elevates reporting from operational tracking to strategic foresight
